# About Project
This Project does the analysis on the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle. It analyzes all the variables like, Age, Pclass, Embarked etc and 
trying to find out if statistically there is a correlation of other varibales to the survival factor of the passengers.

# Project usefulness

How some varibales had NaN values and how they were being handled. The project also includes the Hypothesis of three different
variables to find out their relation with the Survival rate.
